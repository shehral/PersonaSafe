## 🔬 v0.3: Mechanistic Interpretability + UX/Perf (Q1 2026)

**Goal:** Understand WHY persona drift happens at the circuit level

### Integration: circuit-tracer

**What:** Mechanistic interpretability tool for discovering neural circuits
**Why:** PersonaSafe detects WHAT changed, circuit-tracer explains WHY at neuron level

**Features:**
- [ ] Automatic circuit analysis when drift is detected
- [ ] Circuit visualization in dashboard
- [ ] Feature intervention testing
- [ ] Circuit-based steering (more precise than activation steering)
- [ ] Multi-layer circuit tracing

**Implementation:**
```python
# Conceptual API
from personasafe.interpretability import CircuitAnalyzer

analyzer = CircuitAnalyzer(model)
circuit = analyzer.find_circuits(
    trait_vector=toxicity_vector,
    threshold=0.8
)
# Returns: neurons/features responsible for toxic behavior
```

**Architecture:**
```
personasafe/
└── interpretability/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── circuit_analyzer.py     # circuit-tracer wrapper
    ├── visualization.py        # Circuit visualization
    └── intervention.py         # Feature intervention
```

**Timeline:** January–March 2026
**Dependencies:** circuit-tracer repository (2.4k stars, actively maintained)

---

## 🛡️ v0.4: Post-Training Auditing + Multi-Model (Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Verify safety after fine-tuning

### Integration: finetuning-auditor

**What:** Automated auditing agent for fine-tuned models
**Why:** Completes the safety pipeline (PRE-training screening + POST-training verification)

**Features:**
- [ ] Automated safety evaluation after fine-tuning
- [ ] Base vs fine-tuned model comparison
- [ ] Risk scoring (0-10 scale)
- [ ] Multi-tool analysis framework
- [ ] Automated report generation

**Workflow:**
```
1. PersonaSafe screens dataset BEFORE training
   ↓
2. User fine-tunes model
   ↓
3. Finetuning-Auditor verifies AFTER training
   ↓
4. Risk assessment: Safe to deploy?
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Conceptual API
from personasafe.auditing import FineTuningAuditor

auditor = FineTuningAuditor()
report = auditor.audit_finetuning(
    base_model="google/gemma-3-4b",
    finetuned_model="user/gemma-3-4b-finetuned",
    training_data="dataset.jsonl"
)
# Returns: Risk score + detailed analysis
```

**Timeline:** April–June 2026
**Dependencies:** finetuning-auditor repository, API access (OpenAI/Anthropic)

---

## 🤖 Petri: Automated Hypothesis Testing (Optional, Q2 2026+)

**Goal:** Automate alignment research with AI agents

### Integration: petri (Optional - Budget Dependent)

**What:** Alignment auditing agent for rapid hypothesis testing
**Why:** Automate the tedious work of testing safety hypotheses

**Features:**
- [ ] Automated scenario generation
- [ ] Multi-turn conversational audits
- [ ] Custom hypothesis testing
- [ ] Transcript analysis and scoring
- [ ] Integration with PersonaSafe screening results

**Workflow:**
```
PersonaSafe detects: "15% toxicity drift in dataset"
   ↓
Petri tests hypotheses:
- Does toxicity appear under time pressure?
- Is it concealed initially then revealed?
- Does it increase with tool access?
   ↓
Actionable insights for mitigation
```

**Note:** Petri requires significant API budget ($200-500 per comprehensive audit). This integration is optional and recommended only for well-funded projects or research grants.

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (if pursued)
**Dependencies:** petri repository, significant API budget
